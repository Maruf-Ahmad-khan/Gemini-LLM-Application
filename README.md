🌟 Introducing My Latest Project: 
Gemini Chatbot App! 

🌟Have you ever imagined combining the power of AI-driven 
conversational models with image recognition capabilities
to create an intelligent assistant? Well,
that's exactly what I’ve been working on lately!
🚀

👉 What is Gemini Chatbot App?
Gemini Chatbot App is a dynamic application powered by Google's Gemini AI model,
designed to assist users in understanding the world better through conversations
and image inputs. Whether you have a burning question or 
an image you'd like analyzed, Gemini Bot has your back!

✨ Key Features:

🔍 Image Analysis: 
Upload an image and let Gemini Bot generate insightful responses about it.

💬 Conversational AI:
Engage in intelligent, context-aware conversations with the bot for your queries.

🤝 User-Friendly Interface:
A clean, interactive interface built using Streamlit for seamless interaction.

⚡ AI-Powered:
Integrated with Google Generative AI to ensure fast and accurate responses.

🎨 How it Works:

1️⃣ Type in your query OR upload an image.

2️⃣ Sit back and let the Gemini Bot work its magic,
powered by Gemini-1.5-Flash.

3️⃣ View insightful responses in real-time!


👩‍💻 Tech Stack Highlights:

Streamlit:

Simplifies UI design
for a user-friendly experience.

Google Generative AI (Gemini):

Drives the bot's conversational
and image analysis abilities.

Pillow:
Handles image processing.
Python:
Because who doesn’t love Python for AI-driven apps?

🤔 Why Did I Build This?

I’ve always been fascinated by how AI 
can make human lives easier and more interactive.
Gemini Chatbot App is my step toward creating tools 
that combine conversational AI with visual data processing.
It’s more than a chatbot—it’s a companion for your curiosity!




Another project:
**Electric Car Price Prediction**.

This project,
**Electric Car Price Prediction**,
is a Streamlit-based web app
that predicts the price
of electric cars using a 
pre-trained machine learning model.
Users input car features 
such as engine size, curb weight,
horsepower, city MPG, and highway MPG.

The app processes these inputs,
passes them to a linear 
regression model loaded from a pickle file, 
and predicts the car's price. 
The modular design ensures scalability,
with a clear separation of prediction
logic and user interface.
It’s an interactive tool that demonstrates
the application of AI in pricing predictions.
